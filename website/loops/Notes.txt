Wrong Event Element

Mistake: Used input.onclick instead of but.onclick.
Fix: Attach the event listener to the button (but), not the input field.
Incorrect String Interpolation

Mistake: Used double quotes with ${user} instead of backticks.
Fix: Use backticks (`\) for template literals.
Input Value Retrieval

Mistake: Logic didnâ€™t fetch input.value properly when clicking the button.
Fix: Ensure input.value is read inside the button's click handler.
Unclosed Code Block

Mistake: Missing closing } for the function in your JavaScript.
Fix: Always check for proper closure of braces.
Readability

Mistake: Mixed console.log for debugging and user messages.
Fix: Use console.log only for debugging and textContent for user-facing output.

Always use curly braces {} for if and else blocks if they have more than one statement.

// lesson learned : `` is to be used when we want to use the ${variable}
