function calculateTotal(price, discount) {
    return price - discount;
}
let total = calculateTotal(100, 20); // total = 80

When the function's purpose is only to perform an action, like logging, updating UI, or triggering an event.

    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("Alice"); // Prints: Hello, Alice!
